# What this is

This is a collection of many different algorithms and coding projects I've worked on over the last several months tidying up my skills.

I realized suddenly that all them were in private repos... and that I could just make it easier and place them all here.

## Languages

1. Python
2. JavaScript

## Fibonacci and Recursion

should use recursion.

Stop. Get help. Find Binet.

Have you played with CircleCI? It's so, so easy to do. Jeez.
